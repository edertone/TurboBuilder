# frequently used NPM cmd commands


## Run script without installing it globally

node ./src/main/js/index.js

## Generate a node_modules folder strictly from package-lock file contents

If we have checkout a new project form a repo and we want to get exactly the dependencies state as it is expected on its package-lock file, we must use:

npm ci

We will use npm install or update only if we want to modify the dependency tree of the project (update dependency versions, remove unused ones, etc...) 

## Update all the package.json dependencies versions

If we want to put our package.json dependencies to their latest versions, we will use:

npm update

## Install this project globally (so it can be run while being actively developed via cmd "turbobuilder" or "tb" just like the release one)

At the root of this project, call

npm install -g

## Uninstall the project globally (we stop developing it and maybe want to install the official release one)

At the root of this project, call

npm uninstall -g

## List all the globally installed packages

npm ls -g --depth 0

## List outdated global packages

npm -g outdated

## List outdated project packages

npm outdated

## Update an already installed global package

npm i -g <packagename>

## Update an already installed project package

- It can be done by modifying the package.json version and running npm install

## Generate a tarball equal to the published one

This will generate a compressed file with the samen contents that will be published to npm, so you can inspect
it to see that everything is fine:

npm pack

Then you can test this generated tarball file by installing it in your system like:

npm install somezipfile-0.0.4.tgz
npm install -g somezipfile-0.0.4.tgz

## Publish the project to NPM

npm publish
