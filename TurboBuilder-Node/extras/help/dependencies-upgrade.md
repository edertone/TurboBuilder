    npm outdated
    
    Update the package.json versions based on the command result, by running:
    
      npm install libraryname1@latest libraryname2@latest libraryname3@latest
    
- Update all the libraries versions on:

    src\main\libs
        
        - Update the library versions at the site_php index.php file:
            src/main/resources/project-templates/site_php/src/main/index.php
    
        - Check generate.js file contents and update the library versions to match the new ones
        
    src\test\libs

            creating some temporary folder on your pc
            running tb -g site_php
            executing npm ci
            executing npm outdated
            perform the dependencies update
            copy package.json and package-lock.json from the generated project to the project-template files
