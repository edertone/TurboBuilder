# CUSTOM SETUP -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# YOU CAN MODIFY THIS SECTION TO ADD YOUR OWN SITES AND SERVICES


# Use this setup for any websites that contain local static files (you can create as many as you need)
# This will serve the files directly from the folder static-sites-content that must be placed
# in the same directory as the Caddyfile
# https and ssl certificates will be automatically generated for all domains specified in caddy.
some-static-site.com {
    root * /var/www/static-sites/some-static-site.com
    import staticLocalSites
}


# Use this setup if you want to load any remote site on your local host
# Make sure to replace some.domain with the domain you want to load
# Notice that invalid ssl certificates will be ignored

# that must be cached locally to avoid performance issues

    }
    import staticRemoteSites
    # TODO: these type of sites must be locally cached to avoid performance issues
}


# Use this setup for sites or services that are hosted on a different server or vps.
# This will reverse proxy the requests to the server with the IP address and port specified.
# https and ssl certificates will be automatically generated for all domains specified in caddy.
