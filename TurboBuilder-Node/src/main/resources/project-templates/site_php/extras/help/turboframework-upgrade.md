# How to update this project to the latest framework version


1- Make sure turbobuilder is updated to the latest version

2- Update the turbobuilder expected version on this project's turbobuilder.json file

3- Create a tmpfolder and generate a default site_php or server_php project (the same as yours):

    tb -g site_php
    tb -g server_php

4- Update this file with the one created at the generated temporary folder

5- Overwrite all the files found at src/main with the ones on tmpfolder
   (if you have modified any of them, you should update them manually):

    src/main/error-404.php
    src/main/htaccess.txt
    src/main/index.php
    src/main/robots.txt

6- Overwrite all the libraries found at src/main/libs/ with the ones on tmpfolder

7 - Compare the package.json file at the root of this project with the one on tmpfolder. Make sure the dependencies section is the same. If not, update this one, delete the node_modules folder and perform an npm install.

8- Review that turbosite.json and turbobuilder.json are valid compared to the generated ones

9- Review extras folder for outdated documentation

10- Review any other files that may be worth comparing for update
